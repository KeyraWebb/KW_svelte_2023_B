# Inspiration Sites
In order to look for inspiration sites, I looked at modern travel websites so that I could emulate some of the features and functions with my own website. 
The reasoning behind this was so that any user who visited my site would find it easy to navigate due to the familiarity of the design choices.
## New Zealand's Travel Website
View here: https://www.newzealand.com/int/
### Things I liked
- Navigation image card zoom - I liked how when you hovered over the images to navigate the site, it zoomed them in a little, making them almost suck you in and increase interactability. However, I didn't appreciate how abrupt the animation was on this site so I made it smoother when recreating it on my own website
### Things I didn't like
- Information Overwhelm - I didn't like the sheer number of links presented to me on initial viewing of the page, it made me unsure of how to proceed.
## Australia's Travel Website
View here: https://www.australia.com/en-nz
### Things I liked
- Responsiveness - On the main page, I liked how the slogan and and buttons went to the top and the bottom of the image on smaller screens.
- Still image splash - I liked that the single image stood out well and avoided unnecessary disorientation from movement.
- Back to top button - This made for easier navigation and was a nice way to easily return to the base of the page when you're just clicking through
- Rounded edges - the rounded edges for the images and other elements made the site feel a lot warmer and friendlier.
### Things I didn't like
- Mascot Chat - I don't appreciate being harrassed by something wanting to 'talk' to me when I land on a website. It feels like you've been put on the spot when you're just browsing.
## Britain's Travel Website
View here: https://www.visitbritain.com/en
### Things I liked
- Splash screen - While the other sites have their own splash screen landing pages, I liked how this one took up the full screen, grabbing your attention instantly with it's slogan.
- Smaller Number of Main links - I liked how this website had less initial buttons to click, which avoids information overwhelm for newcomers to the page.
### Things I didn't like
- Video splash screen - It made the experience a little disorienting with all the movement
