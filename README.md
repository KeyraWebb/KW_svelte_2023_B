# Visit Lentur√©

This is a website project created for BIT Web 1 in Semester two of 2023. It is a fictional travel website based around a fantasy country that I created.

## Planned/Future features

- Content on the Nature and Culture pages
- Get rid of all placeholder images
- Booking form auto fills the package based on the button that took you to the page
- Booking form tells you the price based on packge and length of stay

## Known Bugs

- If the window is resized with the nav bar open, it becomes either weirdly proportional or unusable. This is due to how the responsiveness is implemented. Nav bar functions normally if opened and closed at any screen width. It also resets the broken state if you just push the button again
- If you get too excited about the carousel gallery and spam click the buttons, it can cause the entire website to freeze and become uninteractable. I'm fairly certain chances of this happening are based on computer power
